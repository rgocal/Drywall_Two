# Drywall_Two
A powerful and open source Wallpaper Provider App for android based on Material 2 design

Drywall is a wallpaper provider I wrote from scratch as a replacement for Google Wallpapers. Unlike many wallpaper dashboards, this is an all in one dashboard and toolkit. The Dashboard counts all the wallpapers and categories for the user while offering wallpaper tools to Blur, Crop, Set a custom image, Change the offset and Rip the current wallpaper to the users memory. Wallpapaers are loaded from rss files the dev manages from the outside.

You are more than welcomed to use Drywall as a base for any wallpaper project but be sure to credit me for the original work. Any kangs of any sort will be taken down.

This is for intermediat and expert android devs

I also will take any pull request that will make the application better!
